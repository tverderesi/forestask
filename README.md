# Florestarefa

Florestarefa is a student-friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA) that doubles as a Learning Management System (LMS) for school staff. With its gamified elements, students can grow their own forest by completing assignments early and earning extra leafycoins, which they can trade for items such as fertilizers, decoration items, and even a barn.

## Features for Students

- Grow your own forest from nothing! Plant seeds and watch them grow into trees and flowers into a beautiful sprawling forest by completing your assignments early.
- Earn extra leafycoins by completing your assignments early and trade them for items such as fertilizers, decoration items, and even a barn.
- View upcoming assignments, deadlines, and grades.
- Set up reminders for assignments, quizzes, and exams.
- Chat with classmates and teachers in real-time.

## Features for Teachers

- Create and manage courses, assignments, quizzes, and exams.
- Track student progress and performance with data-driven insights.
- Take attendance and reward students for their attendance.
- Chat with students and colleagues in real-time.
