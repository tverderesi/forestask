# Florestarefa

Florestarefa is a student-friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA) that doubles as a Learning Management System (LMS) for school staff. With its gamified elements, students can grow their own forest by completing assignments early and earning extra leafycoins, which they can trade for items such as fertilizers, decoration items, and even a barn.

## Features for Students

- Grow your own forest from nothing! Plant seeds and watch them grow into trees and flowers into a beautiful sprawling forest by completing your assignments early.
- Earn extra leafycoins by completing your assignments early and trade them for items such as fertilizers, decoration items, and even a barn.
- View upcoming assignments, deadlines, and grades.
- Set up reminders for assignments, quizzes, and exams.
- Chat with classmates and teachers in real-time.

## Features for Teachers

- Create and manage courses, assignments, quizzes, and exams.
- Track student progress and performance with data-driven insights.
- Take attendance and reward students for their attendance.
- Chat with students and colleagues in real-time.

## Tech Stack

Florestarefa is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and GraphQL for data requests. The following technologies were used:

- MongoDB
- Typescript
- ReactJS
- Framer
- Tailwind
- Node.js
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server and Client
- Vercel

## Pipeline
### 1. Front End:

- [x] Design UI for student interface
- [ ] Design UI for teacher interface
- [ ] Design UI for admin interface
- [x] Implement student interface using React
- [ ] Implement teacher interface using React
- [ ] Implement admin interface using React
- [ ] Integrate UI components with GraphQL queries using Apollo Client
- [x] Implement user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### 2. Back End:

- [x] Create MongoDB database schema
- [ ] Set up GraphQL schema and resolvers using Apollo Server
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for database using Mongoose
- [ ] Set up user authentication and authorization using JWT
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for handling user registration, login, and logout
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for handling data requests from the front-end using GraphQL

### 3. Deployment:

- [x] Deploy MongoDB database to a cloud service provider (e.g. MongoDB Atlas)
- [x] Deploy the back-end server to a cloud service provider (e.g. Heroku, AWS)
- [x] Deploy the front-end application to a cloud service provider (e.g. Vercel)
- [ ] Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools such as GitHub Actions or Travis CI

 ### 4. Implement GraphQL Schema and Resolvers

- [ ] Implement GraphQL Schema and Resolvers
- [ ] Define the GraphQL schema for the application's data model
- [ ] Create resolvers to handle incoming GraphQL queries and mutations
- [ ] Integrate with Apollo Server and Client for server and client-side GraphQL functionality

### 5. Build User Interface Components
- [x] Create reusable components for the different UI elements of the application
- [ ] Design and implement the UI for the student, teacher, and admin interfaces
- [ ] Use React Router to manage navigation between different pages and interfaces

### 6. Implement User Authentication and Authorization
- [x] Build a secure login and registration system for users
- [x] Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization
- [x] Set up user roles and permissions for different interfaces and actions

### 7. Develop CRUD Operations
- [ ] Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for data management
- [ ] Use GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the MongoDB database
- [ ] Ensure data validation and error handling for all CRUD operations

### 8. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Conduct unit and integration testing for each component and functionality
- [ ] Use debugging tools to identify and fix issues in the codebase
- [ ] Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness of the application

### 9. Deployment and Hosting
- [x] Deploy the application to Vercel for hosting and production deployment
- [x] Configure the necessary environment variables and settings for the deployed application
- [ ] Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment and updates.


## Future Development

I plan to add features such as:

- Integration with external calendars such as Google Calendar.
- Parental access to view student progress and performance.
- Assignment submission with file upload.
- Gradebook and report card generation.
