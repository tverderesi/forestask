        <a href="https://allecosta.github.io/florestarefa/">first light</a> in a
        Hackathon for a bootcamp I attended in 2022. It was aimed to help
        students to engage with their schoolwork in a more positive emotional
        aspect and help they stay and not drop out so easily.

        I just got out of a teaching job and was just discovering coding. At the
        time, I was also enthralled by some people that kept their save games
        from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_game">cozy games</a>{" "}
        for years and years.

        I thought that if I could somehow combine the emotional attachment that
        people have to those kind of games with their learning journeys, that
        attachment could somehow spread into their learning, and maybe they
        could engage with it in a healthier way.
