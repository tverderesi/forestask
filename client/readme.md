## Introduction
*[Florestarefa](https://allecosta.github.io/florestarefa/app/main.html)* __(portuguse for a play on words 'forest' and 'task'__) was born out of a meld of passions I've had for a long time: Gaming, Education, and Storytelling. Being a enthusiast in the former and a researcher in the latter, it has always bothered me how the so called 'gamified' experiences weren't truly as such; This was especially notorious during a subject I took during my specialization, in which the students were supposed to create a simple game to teach grade-school concepts. The games that my colleagues developed were nothing but a reskinned PowerPoint presentation. This bothered me so much because I believed a gamified experience should be _fun_ and _appealing_ at its baseline, and those weren't, and out of this dissatisfaction, the concept for Florestarefa was born.

## What is Florestarefa?

The app's final goal is to be a combination between a To-do List and a Learning Management System. 
* _For the student_, it is a friendly app to keep their assignments, tests, and other tasks related to their learning process in a single place.
* _For the staff_, it is a streamlined place to manage those tasks and to keep track of student learning and development.

    But, when taking the design decision to build a to-do list, I kept thinking about two things: the  _Toolbox Fallacy_, which states that you are only able to achieve something only you have the 'correct' provided tools for it, and instead of investing energy in actually getting things done, you spend energy in searching the proverbial right tool for it. The other thing was _How am I going to keep my target audience invested in a to-do list?_. I then thought about some games I either played or admired, especially Stardew Valley, Sims, and Animal Crossing. Those are pretty much 'open-ended' games and yet people keep coming back to it, and sometimes maintain saves that last years. 
    
    Being an avid Sims player myself, I thought on how I loved keep tracking of my Sims life and to see their development over the years and the little stories that they develop through their lives. There was the moment I had a glimpse on how I could make this idea work. Should I instill a sense of attachment and storytelling elements to Florestarefa, the users would feel more enticed to keep coming back to it and seeing their Forests grow. And this attachment to their forests has also a secondary effect, which is to work on the Affective Domain of Learning, which some
    


## Development History

Florestarefas' first iteration was created by my group at StartSe Tech Academy's Hackathon. StartSe's Tech Academy is a bootcamp course I attended between May and August 2022, and the top 150 students from the bootcamp were able to participate in the Hackathon. You can check its [main page](https://allecosta.github.io/florestarefa/) and [the app itself](https://allecosta.github.io/florestarefa/app/main.html). It was build using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Bootstrap and JQuery libraries were also used to speed up coding since the Hackathon lasted five days. This iteration was ranked fourth place at it.


Florestarefa was coded as a front-end PoC using HTML along with Bootstrap 5 and JQuery libraries. I
intend on building a CRUD using React and GraphQL.
